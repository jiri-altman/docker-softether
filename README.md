#[vmware/photon](https://github.com/vmware/photon.git) Docker appliance for SoftEther VPN v14.7

This will deploy a fully functional [SoftEther VPN](https://www.softether.org) server as a dockerised appliance.

Two docker containers - one is for config and log persistency, second is runtime. Fixed problem with timezone - synced with host.
